            </div>1 Driver Issue I just got an &ldquo;ESP8266 D1 mini Dev Broad&rdquo; by a friend of mine, and tried to play around. If you are not familiar, it is an MCU by Espressif company, enhanced by extra features to make it a good dev board.
This dev board is really easy to use (as other Espressif products), specially because of Micro USB (or USB-C) port on it. So you can just connect it to your computer and flash the MCU.]]></description></item></channel></rss>
